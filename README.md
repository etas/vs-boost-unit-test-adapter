# Boost Unit Test Adapter for Microsoft Visual Studio

## Introduction
The Boost Unit Test Adapter is available as a free extension for Microsoft Visual Studio. It makes use of the Unit Test Explorer (UTE) provided by Microsoft in the Visual Studio IDE to visualize and run unit test cases that are written using the open source Boost Unit Test Framework libraries. Boost provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source libraries. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. Boost works on almost any modern operating system, including UNIX and Windows variants.
